# whatismyip
A shell script for determining your external ip address - uses multiple fallback methods.

Sometimes you just need to get the external IP of where ever you are. 
Many ways to skin that cat - but if you wander around on different systems with different toolsets this can take more time than you want to spend - so here is a script to help you cut that time down.

Running this will return the external IP that the internet sees as your IP .. It tries out different tools to do that job but if there are platforms out there where this doesn't work - please let me know and I'll add more methods.

Should work just fine on Mac OS X, FreeBSD and I guess linux - for the most part. Please try it on other platforms and/or make suggestions on how to further improve this small tool.
